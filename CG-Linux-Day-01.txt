#############
- Define concepts 
- Explain the purpose of concepts.
- Working behind the concepts. 

OPerating System - It's a software which manager the computer hadrware, and it's interface between software and hadrware.

- Banking application --> Login to application which is running somewhere in some server.

- OPerating System (User --> INterface "GUI or CLI" --> Kernel --> H/w )
- Libs/bins (COmmands) 
- Kernel upgrade --> Kernel patch (Kernel patching - adding new libs/bins to the kernel).


  Linux is an operating system.
  Enterprise Linux ?
  Associated with SAO and SLA.
  
  Red Hat Linux
  Fedora Linux 
  Centos Linux 
  SUSE Linux 
  SUSE Enterprise Linux etc 
  
  
  
============================

 user   (root/normal/system)
 GUI 
 CLI 
 Kernel 
 Hardware 


Login to Linux system using root and normal account. (#-root, $-normal, system - system user must be having /sbin/nologin shell).
root - Admin user  (At the time of installation, this account already created, we need to setup the password only).
normal - user1,user2,user3 (Created via root or sudo users, when you login using normal account - $ sign )
system - apache (Can not be able to use this account).

How  to know which account used to login to Linux server/system.
# whoami 
root      (Account/User name) 
# pwd
/root     (Default homedir) 


$ whoami 
chandra
$ pwd 

### Assignment-01# Logint o your system, Verify your account and confirm via below commands:-
# whoami 
# pwd
# id 
# cal 
# ls -l or ls -la


### Creating files in Linux system:-
Empty files creation.
1) touch file_name (empty file).
2) touch file1 file2 file3 file4 file5 

Editor to edit/create the file.
# vim <file_name>.txt 
This is my 1st line 
This is ym 2nd line
...................

Example:-
vim <file_name>
Press "i key" for insert mode. 

This is my 1st  via vim 
This is my 2nd 
This is my 3rd line.

Press "Esc key" to lock the file.
:wr

##############################################
Assignment-01#
Create file as mentioned below.

$vim file_name.txt 
Press "i key" for insert mode. 

This is my 1st  via vim 
This is my 2nd 
This is my 3rd line.

Press "Esc key" to lock the file.

:wq 

$ cat file_name 

Note:  It will show the content of the file.


Assignment-02#
$ mkdir dir1 
$ mkdir dir2
$ touch file.txt 
$ file * 
$ mkdir dir1
$ mkdir dir2 
$ touch file.txt 
$ tree dir1 (Nothing)

$ cp <source> <Destination>
$ cp file.txt dir1 

Note: Source is "file.txt" and destination is "dir1".

$ tree dir1 (You will get structure).



- Created file (via touch, vim).
- Created directory & File (dir1 dir2 - using "mkdir").
- Verify the copy operation (cp)

### 

cp dir1 dir2  (It will not copy the content).
ls -l dir2    (Empty dir)

cp -r dir1 dir2  (This will work)

Note: Because we have modified the nature of cp command using option (-r) it means recurstively copy the content.

mkdir dir3 
cp -r -v dir1 dir3  

or 

mkdir dir4 
cp -rv dir1 dir4 
or
cp -vr dir1 dir4 



####

command  Option  Argument1 argument2 
cp -r dir1 dir2
cp -rv dir1 dir4 

cp - 
COmmand - Utility to perform some action 

-r - 
Option (Which modify the nature of command/utility).

dir1 & dir2 - 
Arguments (dir1 is 1st argument and dir2 is 2nd argument).
Argument is a data which required to execute the command/utility.

################################################
2nd Day session:-

####Quick recap:-
1. What is OS (Operating System)?
   user -> Interface (GUI / CLI) -> Kernel -> Hardware 
   
   User - 
    Used for login to system/server.
	Users are 3 types (Admin User = root ; Normal User  = chandra ; System User = apache "When install any software").
	
	su - user_name 
	
	Eg:
	#whoami 
	root
	# pwd
	/root   (Home directory of root user).
	#su - chandra 
 
    $ whoami 
	chandra
	$ pwd
	/home/chandra (Home directory of chandra user). 

2) Some basic operations:-

2.1- Creating file using - touch and editor - vim file_name 
  
  vim file1 
  Press "i key" - insert mode.
  
  Type your contents.
  This is your 2nd line.
  
  Press "Esc key" Lock mode (It mean you will not be able to write anything on file).
  Press ":wq"
  
  cat file1 
  
2.1 mkdir - To create folder (directory)
    mkdir /tmp/DATA or cd /tmp then cd DATA

   cd - Change Directory.
   
   cd directory_name 
   cd /tmp
   cd /tmp/movies/eng/action 
   cd ../..
   
   cd ../  (1 step out) 
   cd ../../..  (3 steps come out )
   
   cd - (privious directory)


####
Assigment-03  (Suppose you have logged in via john user).
$ mkdir BE 
$ cd BE  
$ pwd
/home/john/BE 

$ mkdir CSE ECE IT ME 
$ ls -l 

$ cd CSE 
$ mkdir 1st_year 2nd_year 3rd_year 4th_year 
$ cd 1st_year
$ pwd
/home/john/BE/CSE/1st_year 
$ touch file01.txt
$ cd ../../../  
or 
cd .. ; cd .. ; cd ..

$ pwd
/home 


IN your honme dir 

  CSE --
     1st_year  -> file1
	 2nd_year 
	 3rd_year 
	 4tj_year  -> file3.txt 
	 

mkdir -p BE2/{CSE,IT,ME,ECE}/{1st_year,2nd_year,3rd_year,4th_year}

touch BE2/CSE/1s_year/file1
touch BE2/IT/1s_year/file2

NOw copy file2 to ME/4th_year 
copy file1 to ECE/3rd_year

cp file1 ECE/3rd_year

Write the content using vim 

This is my 1st line 
This is  mmy 2nd line 

:wq

=============================
##### Assigment-04

cut using "mv" 

mkdir -p BE3/{CSE,IT,ME,ECE}/{1st_year,2nd_year,3rd_year,4th_year}
touch BE3/CSE/1s_year/file1
touch BE3/IT/1s_year/file2
touch BE3/ME/1s_year/file3
touch BE3/ECE/1s_year/file4

copy  file1 to ECE/3rd_year  (Use absolute path)
copy file2 to IT/3rd_year    (Use relative path
copy file3 to CSE/3rd_year   (Use absolute path)
copy file4 to ECE/3rd_year    (Use relative path)


NOte: copy - "cp" command 

Use vim and create "file_data" with some contents (File location - /home/user/file_data)
This is 1st line.
This is 2nd line.
:wq 


MOve file to some other location.
mv file_date to IT/2nd_year

"/" - root directory (all sub-directory inside "/" only).

/bin 
/usr/bin 

/sbin
/usr/sbin/useradd 

### Example.
$ which pwd
/bin/pwd 
or 
/usr/bin/pwd  
###

/home - Default fome directoty 
/etc - all configution related data.

===================
Absolute path:-
Absolute path always start "with /" 

Relative path:- 
Relative path not start with "/"
